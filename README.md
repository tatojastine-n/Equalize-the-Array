# Equalize-the-Array
This C# program determines the minimum number of deletions needed to make all elements in an array equal. The `equalizeArray` function counts the frequency of each number, finds the most frequent element, and returns the total number of elements minus this maximum frequency. The `Main` method reads the array from input, calls the function, and outputs the result.
